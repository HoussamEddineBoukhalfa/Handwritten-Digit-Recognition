# Handwritten Digit Recognition 🚀🔢🌟💻

This is my first Project in Limitless Learning Boot-camp🥇🪄, It's a Deep Learning Project 🤖 
about Handwritten Digit Recognition 
I create it Using PyTorch Python Framework with the MNIST Dataset👓 8️⃣9️⃣ . 

### Learning Objectives 🎯

- **Understanding PyTorch**: Get hands-on experience with PyTorch, understanding its basic operations and how to build models with it.
- **Model Optimization**: Explore various training optimization techniques such as adding dropout layers, implementing regularizers, and utilizing early stopping to enhance model performance.
- **Experimentation**: Test different hyperparameters and observe how they impact your model's learning process and accuracy.

### Project Structure 🗂️

- **Data Preprocessing**: Learn how to prepare your data for optimal model training.
- **Model Building**: Design a neural network architecture suitable for digit recognition.
- **Training and Testing**: Implement the training loop, and test your model's performance.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Apply different optimization strategies to improve your model.

### Final Result 🖼️🤩
#### The Best Accuracy is 97.61%
- Accuracy of the complex model on the test images: 97.61%
- Accuracy of the simple model on the test images: 92.22%
- Accuracy of the Early Stopping model on the test images: 92.22%
- Accuracy of the model with dropout on the test images: 11.26%
